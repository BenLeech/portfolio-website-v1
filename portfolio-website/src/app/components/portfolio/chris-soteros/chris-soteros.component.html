    <p>For my Computer Science 281 Website Design and Development class, I worked with a group of
    three other students throughout the semester to develop this website. It is a portfolio website
    for a Mathematics and Statistics professor at the University of Saskatchewan that showcases her
      background, research, publications, classes, and contact info.</p>

    <p>We met with the professor several times during the design process to ensure we properly developed
    what she wanted, and to pitch our design ideas and mock-ups.</p>
