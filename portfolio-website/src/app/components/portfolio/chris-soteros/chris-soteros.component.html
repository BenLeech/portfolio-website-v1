        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>For my Computer Science 281 Website Design and Development class, I worked with a group of
          three other students throughout the semester to develop this website from the ground up. It is a portfolio website
          for a Mathematics and Statistics professor at the University of Saskatchewan that showcases her
          background, research, publications, classes, and contact info.</p>

        <p>We met with the professor several times during the design process to ensure we properly developed
          what she wanted, and to pitch our design ideas and mock-ups.</p>

        <p>The site features a navigation bar that fixes to the top of the screen if the page is scrolled down,
          nested collapsible information panels, easy insertion of new data or text, and a data table of
          publications that is sortable based on name or date.
